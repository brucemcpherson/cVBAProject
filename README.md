To get started with VBA Git, you can either create a workbook with the code here in it, or use this premade [VbaBootStrap workbook](http://ramblings.mcpher.com/Home/excelquirks/downlable-items/VbaGitBootStrap.xlsm "VbaBootStrap")  
Now update manually with details of this project - this skeleton file is committed only when there is no README.md in the repo.
